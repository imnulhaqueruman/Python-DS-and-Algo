# Class 1 

## What is an Algorithm?
### An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions

## What is Data Structure? 

### Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.

### Basic Data Structure Discussion 1. Array 2. List in Python 

## What is List in Python ? 

### List is Data Structure in Python that is collection of data , which is changeable,ordered and allow duplicate values .Each values or data inside of list is called items.Lists are created using square brackets.List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

### When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

# Defining List in Python. 

## Empty List
 ### []
## List With Values 
### list = [1,2,3,4,5]

## Access item in List 
### list[0] list[1] list[2] ... etc

## What is Notations?
## There are different notations we can use to express space complexity measurements. The most widely used is big-O notation, and that’ll be our main focus. Also, we’ll briefly define other common notations.

## What is Complexity

## Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n).

## What is Big ,O Notation ?

## Big O is a notation used to express any computer algorithm's complexity in terms of time and space. , Big O refers to how an algorithm scales concerning its input.

# Types Of Complexity 
1. Time Complexity 
1. Space Complexity

## Time Complexity
## Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.

## The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the big O notation. It's an asymptotic notation to represent the time complexity.

## Space Complexity

## Space complexity measures the total amount of memory that an algorithm or operation needs to run according to its input size.
## There are different types of time complexities used.
1. Constant Time O(1)
2. Linear Time o(n)

## Constant time – O (1)

## An algorithm is said to have constant time with order O (1) when it is not dependent on the input size n. Irrespective of the input size n, the runtime will always be the same.

## Linear Time - O(n)

## An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time increases linearly with the length of the input. When the function involves checking all the values in an input data, such function has Time complexity with this order O(n).

## What is Two Pointer Algorithm?

## Two pointer Algorithm is used to solve array ,string ,linkedList and so many other codein problems.
## It's main purpose to reduce the time complexity of code for searching element in array .
