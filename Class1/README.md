# What is List in Python ? 

### List is Data Structure in Python that is collection of data , which is changeable,ordered and allow duplicate values .Each values or data inside of list is called items.Lists are created using square brackets.List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

### When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
